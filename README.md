# Junkyard

Yet another portable C++ framework to make games and maybe some other related high-performance applications.

The goal is to focus on simplicity, fast iteration and development. Features will be developed based on the game/projects I do with it, so this is not going to be do-it-all engine/framework at all, but probably with a strong foundation to build your own renderers and other stuff on top of it.

It's very much WIP, so not much to show off right now.

## Overview and Features

- Multiplatform. Currently supported platforms (ARM64, x86_64 architectures only):
    - Windows (Tested on Windows 10 x64)
    - Linux (Tested on Ubuntu 22/PopOS)
    - MacOS-Arm64 M1 and up (through MoltenVk 1.3)
    - ~~Android~~ (Currently broken, might work with Vulkan 1.3 hardware)
- Minimal C'ish C++20: Some people call it Sane-C++ or similarly [Orthodox-C++](https://gist.github.com/bkaradzic/2e39896bc7d8c34e042b). I use a very small subset of newer C++ standards, in which I will explain later in the wiki. Some of them are pointed in [CppFeatures.txt](doc/CppFeatures.txt)
    - No stdc++ allowed in the code
    - No RTTI/Exceptions
    - Relying heavily on POD (Plain-old-data) structs, zero-init by default and avoiding implicit code in ctors/dtors
    - Minimal template functions and macros (mainly used in core containers). No fancy stuff!
- Very strict memory allocation/resource allocation in most systems:
    - Relying heavily on custom allocators especially virtual memory paging and bump allocation
    - Debugging capabilities for memory stats
    - Temp allocator. Which is a push/pop stack based bump allocator used for temporary allocations within the functions/frame
    - Custom memory allocations for GPU
- Design-wise, very much in contrast to *stl*, it has it's own portable C++ Core library: Array, Math, FileIO, HashTable, HandlePool, Buffers, Log, etc: [Core](code/Core). You can also use this core library in your own code, just by grabbing a copy of the folder and copy it over to your program or use `scripts/Code/amalgamate-core.py` script to choose subsets and make one big translation unit or even a single header from Core library.
- Simple [Fiber-based job system](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022186/Parallelizing-the-Naughty-Dog-Engine), with custom Signal synchronization primitives.
- Vulkan graphics backend with HLSL shaders (Slang)
- Fast iteration
    - Quick build/compile times (2s debug rebuild)
    - Aim for simple tooling with minimal abstraction or complexity
    - Support for [LivePP](https://liveplusplus.tech/) 
- ImGui integration
- Simple Camera (Orbital + Fps)
- [Tracy profiler](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) integration
- Virtual filesystem
- Async asset manager
    - Automatic asset baking with metadata descriptors (PNG/JPG->BCn/ASTC, GLTF->meshoptimizer, HLSL->SPIRV)
    - All asset baking is done on PC and can also be streamed over to other deployment platforms through TCP/IP (server mode)
    - Multithreaded asset loading and baking
    - Local asset caching
    - Hot-reloading assets
        - [x] Shaders
        - [x] Images
        - [x] Models

## Dependencies
External dependencies are a pretty big deal imo, so I'm going to pay special attention to them. They are part of your code even if you don't write them yourself and they all play a big role in compile-times, maintenance, deployment and technical debt of your code. So I try to keep the dependencies small and to minimum. Most of the dependencies here are simple stb-style single-header C libs, but some just can't be as small and quick-to-compile as I want them to be (eg Physics/Audio/Baking/ShaderCompilers/etc), usually those ones are downloaded off the internet and not part of the repo. Anyway, here they are:

- [VulkanSDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/): Used for the graphics backend. 
- [c89atomics](https://github.com/mackron/c89atomic): Replacement for std atomics. Don't want to use `<atomic>` because it's part of std-C++ crap and it's [huge](https://build-bench.com/b/-_WeHavwOPkGBvI3ed5KNnpdgmk), and C11 `<stdatomic>` is not available for msvc2019. I might try to remove this for `<stdatomic>` if I intend to ditch msvc2019 and go strictly for msvc2022.

## Build and Deployment
*PC/Windows* is the primary platform, because it's the platform I use for my daily development. Maintaining build and tooling on multiple OSes is just a lot of work. So please keep in mind that other platforms might be buggy, not as polished or not fully feature complete. To build and run the projects, first thing is running the Setup script after fetching the repo:

### Setup.bat/Setup.sh
This script fetches, heavier dependencies for baking assets. And there is also the option to download and install required or optional SDKs and standalone tools.

So first, you need to run `Setup.bat` (or `Setup.sh` if you are in a Unix environment).

Steps:
- *Install code dependencies*: This is mandatory if you are fetching the code for the first time. It fetches the following binaries:
    - Slang
    - meshoptimizer
    - ISPC Texture compressor
- *Vulkan SDK*: This is also mandatory if you haven't installed it yet. This also fetches vulkan validation layer for all platforms. For windows, make sure `VULKAN_SDK` and `VK_LAYER_PATH` env vars are set.
- *MoltenVK*: (MacOS required) This is a Vulkan-to-Metal translation layer that is required only on MacOS setup.
- *Tracy Profiler*: (optional) This is a very good GUI tool for profiling
- *LivePP*: (Windows optional) A powerful commercial C++ code-reloading software. Note that you'll need a valid license to use this feature.
- Python 3.10+: (Windows optional) If you want some extra script goodies to work, mainly platform helpers, have python installed.
- *Android extra*: (optional) For android development some additional tools can be downloaded which is optional of course!

### Windows
Compatible with **Visual studio 2019 (build tools v142)** and **Visual Studio 2022 (build tools v143)** build environments.   
There are multiple ways to build binaries on windows: 
- **Visual studio solution**: The easiest and most convenient method on Windows. open `projects/Windows/Junkyard.sln` and build projects. So far, there are three configurations:
    - `Debug`: The name says it, all debug symbols are included, no optimizations, etc.
    - `ReleaseDev`: Symbols and Tracy profiler is enabled by default in this build. You might want to use this for Profiling and basic release build validation, because it also enables assertions.
    - `Release`: Fully optimized build.
- **Unity Build**: This is a quick way to build without relying on any build systems. You just need a CL compiler. This is useful, because I can build with different compile-flags quickly without the need to blow-up build configurations. For example, ASAN can be built this way just by adding the flag to command-line. To build this way, see related `build-xxxx` batch scripts in `scripts/build` folder.
- **CMake**: Although not the first-class citizen, CMake can also be optionally used to generate projects. Also useful to experiment with other build systems like *Ninja*. It's just a single cmake file and it's in `projects/CMake` directory.

<sub>**Note**: Binaries on windows are built with `/DEBUG:FULL /Zi` so that they are compatible with [RemedyBG debugger](https://remedybg.itch.io/remedybg) and LivePP.</sub>

## Linux
Linux binaries currently can only be built with clang toolset. The most convenient and tested method is using *Visual Studio Code* with the following extensions:
- Clangd
- CMakeTools
- CodeLLDB
  
Just make sure you have already ran `Setup.sh` successfully and have this packages installed (Setup script will try to install them automatically on Ubuntu based distros):
- clang
- cmake
- pkg-config
- libglfw3-dev
- uuid-dev
- libc++-dev
- libc++abi-dev

Then open the project folder with *vscode* and choose your preferred configuration, build and launch with *LaunchLinux* target.

### MacOS
Graphics backend on MacOS runs through the latest MoltenVK which has Vulkan 1.3 support. As usual start with running `Setup.sh` script. Make sure to download tooling library dependencies and MoltenVK. MoltenVK will be downloaded into `$(ProjectRoot)/.downloads` directory. 

Next step is downloading VulkanSDK 1.3 (will be automated later through Setup script) and run it's installer script (`install_vulkan.py` in the VulkanSDK root folder) to install vulkan library into `/usr/local/lib`. The Xcode project links to `libvulkan.dylib` and then by setting `VK_ICD_FILENAMES` environment variable (see Schemes in the Xcode project) to the local `.download/MoltenVK` directory, we make sure that the loader uses our version of MoltenVK. We also set `VK_LAYER_PATH` to the installed vulkan path (Again, see Schemes in the Xcode project), so we can use the always important vulkan validation layer.

And that's it. Open the Xcode project and run your targets.

## Running the Examples
Currently, there are a few very basic examples. First thing to consider is that you must run the examples with **Current Directory** set to the root path of the project so `data` directory can be accessed by them.

They also usually require some sort of asset files. The example assets are not included in the repo, so you need to download those with provided scripts. All test/example apps reside in `code/Tests` directory, each as a single cpp file:

- *TestAsset*: Synthetic asset manager test program. Loads and unloads blocks of unique assets laid out on a grid. Before running the example, make sure to run the script `code/Tests/TestAsset.bat` (or `code/Tests/TestAsset.sh`). This will actually run a python script to procedurally generate some assets in `data/TestAsset`.
- *TestBasicGfx*: Basic graphics backend tests. Contains multiple scenes, mostly with GLTF meshes. Before running this example, make sure to run the script `code/Tests/TestBasicGfx.bat` (or `code/Tests/TestBasicGfx.sh`). This will also fetch some GLTF meshes+textures from the internet and put them in `data/TestBasicGfx`.
- *TestIO*: Synthetic IO (Async) tests. Before running this one, make sure to run the script `code/Tests/TestIO.bat` (or `code/Tests/TestIO.sh`). 

### Remote Asset Baking
Optionally. you can load bake assets remotely through TCP/IP connection. For example, on mobile platforms, There is no deployment of source assets on the device and APKs are kept light and does not contain anything other than executable binaries. So for those platforms, it is actually a requirement to bake assets remotely, after they are baked, they will be cached on the target device.

So to run on mobile/consoles platforms that require server-side asset baking, you should always first start up `JunkyardTool`. It's either included in windows solution or you can use the quick batch scripts that builds and runs it: `scripts/Build/build-run-tool.bat`.

Then, Provide your host PC ip address for `Settings.ini` file: 

```
[Engine]
connectToServer: true
remoteServicesUrl: [HOST_PC_IP]:6006
```

Or set it with command line arguments: `-EngineConnectToServer=1 -EngineRemoteServicesUrl=[host_ip]`
