Some assets are compressed and should be extracted before launching examples.

- TestAsset: These Assets are procedurally created. You should have python installed, and then run "code/Tests/TestAsset.bat"
- TestBasicGfx/TestRenderer: Some basic open-sourced assets are compressed in "data/TestBasicGfx.zip". Extract that into the "data" folder or just run "Setup.bat" script
