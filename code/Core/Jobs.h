// JobSystem: Fiber based. Inspired by Naughty dog's talk: https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022186/Parallelizing-the-Naughty-Dog-Engine
// 
// Dispatch: 
//      There are two ways of dispatching jobs. `Dispatch` and `DispatchAuto`. 
//      For regular `Dispatch`, you have to wait for job completion later using `WaitForCompletion` function. This will also delete the job handle.
//      For `DispatchAuto`, There are no handles returned, so you can't wait on the job, and the job will automatically delete itself when it finishes.
//
//      Dispatches can be done in groups. You can provide groupSize in the API, so it dispaches the job across several threads, instead of one. 
//      You will also get `groupIndex` in the job callback, so you know which group we are running on
//
//      Priority: Higher priorities have a chance of executing sooner than lower ones
//
// Thread Model:
//      threadCount will be fetched from the engine being equal to CpuCoreCount - 1 if set to 0 on initialize. Note that this is actual PhysicalCores, not the Logical ones
//      
//      ShortTask: As the name suggests, short tasks are expected to do small amount of work. They should also finish before the current frame ends. 
//                 There are numCores-1 threads of this type in the thread pool by default
//      LongTask: Long tasks are expected to do IO or longer jobs. They can span across several threads as well.
//                There are numCores-1 threads of this type in the thread pool by default
//                They also run on the lower priority threads as opposed to ShortTask types. So by nature ShortTasks have higher priority for cpu execution
