Only these C++ features are allowed to be used in the code.
Any stl/stdc++ code is prohibited and should be implemented in the core library instead
No exceptions
No RTTI

c++20: 
    - Designated initializers
    
C++17:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/features-of-c17-with-examples/
    - Variable declaration in if and switch. 
    - if constexpr() - Rarely when makes it only makes calls to non-platform specific code
    - utf8 character literals
    - [[maybe_used]]
    - [[nodiscard]]
    - [[deprecated]]
    - inline variables

C++14:
    - functors: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functors-in-cpp/?ref=lbp (Rarely)
    - generalized lambda expressions
    - Extended capturing in lambdas
    - static_assert

C++11/98:
    - constexpr for constants
    - regular operators for math primitives
    - Minimal templates (containers/some generic small functions)
    - Default arguments
    - Function overrides
    - Limited use of ctor/dtor and default constructors
    - C++ ABI (return structs as value)
    - "using" keyword
